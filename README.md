# driftlock-labs

Public reference labs, artifacts, and governance patterns exploring cloud-native policy engineering, cloud governance, and DriftLock design patterns.

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **public workspace and reference collection** for exploring how governance decisions are designed, expressed, and validated in modern cloud-native environments.

The artifacts here reflect the practical side of **policy engineering**:
- how intent becomes policy,
- how policy becomes enforceable,
- and how teams reason about drift before it becomes risk.

This is not a tutorial dump or a complete curriculum.  
It is a **portfolio of applied thinking**—designed to show how governance is approached, not just how tools are used.

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository may include:

- Reference labs demonstrating environment setup and observation-first workflows  
- Governance and policy design patterns expressed in code and documentation  
- Preflight and validation scripts used to reason about configuration and drift  
- Templates and scaffolding for governance catalogs and policy messaging  
- Experimental or exploratory artifacts related to cloud-native policy engineering  

Each artifact is intentionally scoped and self-contained.  
Nothing here requires prior enrollment in a course to understand.

## What This Repository Is Not

To be explicit, this repository is **not**:

- The full DriftLock Foundations course  
- A complete lab workbook or guided training path  
- A collection of answer keys or step-by-step enforcement tutorials  
- A replacement for structured instruction or advisory engagement  

Some examples may preview *how* DriftLock approaches problems, but they do not reproduce paid course content or proprietary instructional material.

---

## How to Use This Repository

You are encouraged to:

- Explore the labs and artifacts as reference implementations  
- Run the environments locally or in GitHub Codespaces  
- Adapt patterns for learning, experimentation, or internal use  
- Use the materials as inspiration for your own governance designs  

You are **not expected** to treat this repo as a linear learning path.  
Think of it as a **library**, not a syllabus.

## About DriftLock

DriftLock is a governance-first framework focused on helping teams design, implement, and operate enforceable policy with clarity and intent.

Rather than starting with tools, DriftLock emphasizes:
- decision-making before enforcement,
- governance before automation,
- and feedback before friction.

The framework is applied across cloud platforms, Kubernetes environments, and CI/CD systems, with an emphasis on developer experience and operational sustainability.

## About the Architect

This repository reflects the work and thinking of **Wynoks Munlyn**, architect of the DriftLock framework.

The artifacts here represent ongoing exploration and applied practice in:
- cloud governance,
- policy engineering,
- and automation-aligned security design.
